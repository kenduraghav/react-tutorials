# 100DaysOfCode

## Day1:

Started to learn reactjs

## Day 9:

Today I have learning, component life cycles of Reactjs and worked on a simple search component after struggling with small mistakes.

### **Thoughts**: My mind was trying to set back me from the challenge. I'm fighting with it, to keep the habit.

## Day 10:

Today is not productive. Just revisited basics learnt so far.

**Thoughts** : Bit tired mentally and physically.

## Day 11:

Today I learned about DefaultProps and propTypes. Taken few #react challenges from #freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** as the progress goes with challenge, felt little more productive, comparing yesterday.

## Day 12:

I was trying to clone MarkDown Syntax as today's experiment.

**Thoughts** Re-inventing a wheel requires more knowledge about it.

## Day 13:

Again I have worked on Markdown / Asciidoc preview component. Invoking REST Api using SparkJava and returns asciidoctor output and rendered using React.

**Thoughts** Feeling good and at same time sleepy. More way to go.

## Day 14:

Skipped due to restless night on previous day. Took a break.

## Day 15:

Took React challenges on freeCodeCamp and completed the basics of ReactJS. Learned about callbacks

**Thoughts** Learned about different aspects and key concepts of React. React challenges is the easier way to learn the concepts.
