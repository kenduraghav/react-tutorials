# 100DaysOfCode

## Day1:

Started to learn reactjs

## Day 9:

Today I have learning, component life cycles of Reactjs and worked on a simple search component after struggling with small mistakes.

### **Thoughts**: My mind was trying to set back me from the challenge. I'm fighting with it, to keep the habit.

## Day 10:

Today is not productive. Just revisited basics learnt so far.

**Thoughts** : Bit tired mentally and physically.

## Day 11:

Today I learned about DefaultProps and propTypes. Taken few #react challenges from #freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** as the progress goes with challenge, felt little more productive, comparing yesterday.
